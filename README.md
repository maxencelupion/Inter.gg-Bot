# Inter.gg Bot
A small bot developed by myself to tracks all of your LoL account on Discord. Every 60 seconds, the bot will sends if a user is in game, and then sends the results with the new rank.
The bot works only with EUW LoL accounts, for Solo and Flex queues.

## Usage
To init the bot to a channel:
```
/init_bot channel_id:{channel_id to use}
```
Get started message:
```bash
/get_started 
```
To add an account:
```bash
/add_account pseudo:{pseudo of the account to add} tag:{tag of the account to add}
```
To remove an account:
```bash
/remove_account pseudo:{pseudo of the account to add} tag:{tag of the account to add}
```
To show all accounts added from the server:
```bash
/show_accounts
```
